# Project Prometheus: Blocks Broken Down into Tasks

**Document Version:** 1.5 (Incl. Stage 2 SOP Gen)
**Date:** May 8, 2025
**Prepared by:** AI Systems Lead (with PM Support)

This document breaks down the major blocks within each phase into tasks, noting that SOP Generation, User Chat, and Task Management are planned as "Stage 2" features for development post-Phase 5.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup, CMMS Strategy Execution (Initial Steps), & Initial Agent Validation
(No changes to tasks from v1.1)
### Block 1.1 - 1.3: (Tasks remain as in v1.1)

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval (incl. Advanced Diagram/Image Processing & Retrieval), Fusion & Efficiency Baseline
(No changes to tasks from v1.1)
### Block 2.1 - 2.4: (Tasks remain as in v1.1)

---

## Phase 3: Scalable Orchestration, Synthesis, UI & CI/CD Setup
(No changes to tasks for Blocks 3.1-3.5 from v1.2)
### Block 3.1: Agent Orchestration Integration & Core Agent Scaling
### Block 3.2: Advanced Synthesis & Adaptive Interaction Agent Development
### Block 3.3: UI Prototyping (with Diagram Display) & Central-Plant Communication Setup
### Block 3.4: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation & Initial Power Optimization
### Block 3.5: Foundational Module Development (Troubleshooting/Multilingual/ROI)

---

## Phase 4: Production Readiness, Agent Refinement, Security Hardening & Efficiency Tuning
(No changes to tasks for Blocks 4.1-4.7 from v1.4)
### Block 4.1: Final Core Agent Intelligence & Safety Mechanism Development
### Block 4.2: Troubleshooting & Multilingual Module Integration & Testing
### Block 4.3: ROI Calculation Module Development & Integration
### Block 4.4: Comprehensive Security Implementation & Hardening
### Block 4.5: Full UI Build (incl. Audio, Language, ROI Dashboard) & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
### Block 4.6: Production Performance & Power Efficiency Optimization
### Block 4.7: Mature CI/CD & Deployment Dry Runs

---

## Phase 5: Central System Deployment, Plant Rollout (Connectivity & Access) & Continuous Improvement Kickoff
(No changes to tasks from v1.3)
### Block 5.1: Central System Production Deployment & Validation
### Block 5.2: Plant Connectivity Rollout & Access Provisioning
### Block 5.3: User Training (incl. Module Features)
### Block 5.4: Formal Continuous Improvement Process Establishment (incl. process for reviewing ROI data)

---

## Phase 6: Ongoing Continuous Improvement & Maintenance (Cycles)

### Block 6.1 - Block 6.4: (Tasks remain largely as in v1.2)
### Block 6.5: ROI Module Refinement & Reporting Cycle
* **Tasks:** (Remain as in v1.4)

### Block 6.6 (New - Stage 2): SOP Generation Module Development & Rollout (If prioritized)
* **Focus:** Developing Synthesis Agent prompts for SOPs, potential Markdown-to-PDF tool, UI for draft review, and establishing human review workflow.
* **Tasks (High-Level):**
    * **Task 6.6.1:** Design and test specific prompts for the `SynthesisAgent` to generate SOPs/instructions in Markdown format based on retrieved context.
    * **Task 6.6.2:** Develop UI components for users to initiate SOP generation requests and view/edit the generated Markdown drafts.
    * **Task 6.6.3:** (Optional) Develop or integrate a `MarkdownToPdfTool` for converting drafts to printable formats, potentially applying templates.
    * **Task 6.6.4:** Define and document the mandatory human review and approval workflow for generated SOPs. Implement UI elements to support this workflow (e.g., status tracking, approval buttons for authorized users).
    * **Task 6.6.5:** Testing (Functional, quality of generated drafts, usability of review interface).
    * **Task 6.6.6:** Phased Rollout & User Training on SOP generation feature and review process.

### Block 6.7 (Formerly 6.5): Chat Module Development & Rollout (Stage 2)
* **Tasks (High-Level):** (Remain as in v1.4)

### Block 6.8 (Formerly 6.6): Task Management Module Development & Rollout (Stage 2)
* **Tasks (High-Level):** (Remain as in v1.4)
