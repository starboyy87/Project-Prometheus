# Project Prometheus: ROI Analysis Perspectives

This document outlines the key components for calculating the Return on Investment (ROI) for Project Prometheus from two distinct perspectives: A) As a potential B2B product sold by a new company, and B) As an internal system deployed within the existing five manufacturing plants.

**Note:** Calculating a precise ROI figure requires specific financial data (development costs, potential revenue, quantified savings, etc.) which are not fully defined here. This analysis focuses on identifying the *types* of investments and returns involved.

## Perspective A: Starting a B2B Business Selling Prometheus

This scenario involves creating a commercial product based on Project Prometheus and selling it to other manufacturing companies.

**1. Investment (I):**

* **Product Development Costs:**
    * Salaries/Contractor fees for a larger development team (AI/ML engineers, backend, frontend, UX/UI, QA, MLOps). Likely significantly higher than the internal project cost.
    * Robust infrastructure for development, testing, staging, and potentially demos (Cloud or On-Premise).
    * Software/Tooling licenses (potentially commercial licenses for databases, AI models, development tools).
    * Effort to generalize the product beyond the initial 5-plant context (handling different CMMS systems, diverse document types, broader industry needs).
* **Business Startup & Operational Costs:**
    * Legal fees (incorporation, contracts, IP protection).
    * Sales & Marketing (Salaries, advertising, travel, conferences).
    * Customer Support infrastructure and personnel.
    * General & Administrative (Office space, utilities, finance, HR).
* **Implementation & Deployment Costs (for customers):**
    * Costs associated with deploying and integrating the system for each new B2B customer.

**2. Return (R):**

* **Direct Revenue:**
    * Software Licensing Fees (e.g., per plant, per user, per server, tiered features).
    * Subscription Fees (if offered as SaaS).
    * Implementation & Integration Service Fees.
    * Customization Service Fees.
    * Ongoing Support & Maintenance Contracts.
    * Training Service Fees.
* **Indirect/Strategic Value:**
    * Company Valuation (potential for investment or acquisition).
    * Market Share & Brand Recognition.

**3. ROI Calculation Framework:**

* `ROI = [(Total Revenue + Strategic Value Gain) - (Total Development + Startup + Operational Costs)] / (Total Development + Startup + Operational Costs) * 100%`
* **Key Considerations:** Requires market analysis (TAM, SAM, SOM), competitive analysis, robust pricing strategy, realistic sales projections, cost of customer acquisition (CAC), customer lifetime value (CLV), and operational cost management. This is a standard business case analysis.

## Perspective B: Internal Deployment within the 5 Plants

This scenario focuses on the value generated by using Project Prometheus within your own manufacturing operations.

**1. Investment (I):**

* **Development & Deployment Costs:**
    * Internal Personnel Costs (AI Systems Lead, developers, PM time allocated over the project duration - Phases 1-5).
    * External/Incremental Costs (Hardware for central server(s), Software licenses like MVP One Gold Tier, potential cloud costs, specialized tools - aligning with the **$40k - $100k+ estimate**).
    * Network infrastructure costs (if upgrades needed for central access).
    * Deployment effort (IT service time for setup, integration).
* **Training & Change Management Costs:**
    * Developing training materials for operators, technicians, supervisors, engineers.
    * Time spent by employees undergoing training.
    * Communication and efforts to drive adoption.
* **Ongoing Maintenance & Operational Costs:**
    * Personnel time for system upkeep, monitoring, updates (Phase 6).
    * Power consumption for the central server(s).
    * Software license renewals.
    * Hardware maintenance/refresh cycles.

**2. Return (R) - Primarily Cost Savings & Efficiency Gains:**

* **Quantifiable Cost Savings:**
    * **Reduced Downtime:** Calculate the average cost per hour of downtime for critical equipment and estimate the percentage reduction achieved through faster troubleshooting using Prometheus. (e.g., `Avg Downtime Hours/Year * Cost/Hour * % Reduction`).
    * **Reduced Repair Costs:** Estimate savings from improved first-time fix rates (fewer repeat visits, less wasted labor) and potentially lower emergency parts shipping costs.
    * **Optimized MRO Inventory:** Estimate savings from reduced carrying costs due to better insights into parts usage (requires integration with inventory value data).
    * **Reduced Time Searching:** Estimate labor cost savings by calculating time saved per user role searching for information multiplied by their loaded cost and frequency. (e.g., `Avg Time Saved/Query * Queries/Day * Users * Days/Year * Avg Labor Cost/Hour`).
* **Efficiency & Productivity Gains (Harder to Quantify Directly):**
    * Increased technician wrench time (less time on admin/searching).
    * Faster completion of maintenance tasks.
    * Improved accuracy of diagnostics.
    * Faster onboarding of new personnel.
* **Risk Reduction (Hardest to Quantify):**
    * Improved safety through easier access to procedures.
    * Better compliance documentation access, potentially reducing audit findings or fines.
* **Indirect Benefits:** Potential for increased production output due to higher asset availability.

**3. ROI Calculation Framework:**

* `ROI = (Total Quantified Annual Savings/Benefits * Time Period - Total Investment) / Total Investment * 100%`
* **Payback Period:** `Total Investment / Total Quantified Annual Savings/Benefits` (How long it takes for savings to recoup the investment).
* **Key Considerations:** Requires establishing accurate baseline metrics *before* deployment (downtime hours/costs, average search times, repair costs). Needs realistic estimates of the percentage improvements Prometheus can deliver. User adoption is critical â€“ benefits are only realized if the system is used effectively. Benefits accrue over time.

Both perspectives require different types of data and analysis, but clearly outlining the investment components and the potential return categories is the first step in building a compelling ROI case for either scenario.
