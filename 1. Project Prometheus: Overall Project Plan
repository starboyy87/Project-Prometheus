# Project Prometheus: Overall Project Plan

**Document Version:** 1.5 (Incl. Stage 2 SOP Gen)
**Date:** May 8, 2025
**Prepared for:** Executive Team
**Prepared by:** AI Systems Lead (with PM Support)
**Project Location:** `C:\prometheus`

## 1. Executive Summary

Project Prometheus will deliver an advanced, multi-agent multimodal RAG system architected for extreme intelligence, production-level utility, upgradability, security, and efficiency. It will process documents and CMMS logs with cutting-edge accuracy, deployed centrally. Key features include advanced diagram/image extraction, modular expert troubleshooting (UI & Audio), multilingual support, and an ROI calculation module. Enhanced with an 8+ agent framework, GPU acceleration, caching, robust security, power efficiency, continuous improvement loops, and a user-friendly UI, it ensures ultra-fast performance and comprehensive understanding. **Future development ("Stage 2") plans include adding capabilities for generating draft Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), user-to-user chat, and task management.** The architecture emphasizes modularity. The total investment estimate for the core RAG system (Phases 1-5) is **$40,000 - $105,000+** (reflecting central hardware), with Stage 2 features requiring separate future budget allocation.

    * Vector Database (Qdrant).
    * Graph Database (Neo4j).
    * Document Processing Pipeline.
    * Integration with MVP One CMMS.
    * Potential Orchestration Framework (e.g., Ray).
    * Advanced Reasoning Models (e.g., Google Gemini).
    * Modular Components (TTS, Language Detection, Translation Tools, ROI Calculation Module).
    * **Future Modular Components (Stage 2):**
        * **SOP Generation Logic (Prompting/Formatting).**
        * **(Optional) Markdown-to-Printable Format Converter.**
        * Real-time Chat Service & Database.
        * Task Management Service & Database.
    * Containerization (e.g., Docker).
    * CI/CD Practices.
    * Comprehensive Security Suite.
    * Power Monitoring & Optimization strategies.
    * Intuitive, role-based User Interface (**with features for initiating/reviewing SOP drafts in Stage 2**).

## 5. High-Level Timeline

* **Phases 1-5 (Core RAG System + ROI Module):** Estimated **21â€“27 weeks**.
    * Phase 1: Foundation Setup (3-5 weeks)
    * Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval (Visuals) (4-5 weeks)
    * Phase 3: Scaling, Synthesis, UI Proto, CI/CD (5-7 weeks)
    * Phase 4: Production Readiness, Module Integration (Troubleshooting/Multilingual/ROI) (6-8 weeks)
    * Phase 5: Central Deployment, Plant Rollout, CI Kickoff (4-5 weeks)
* **Stage 2 Development (SOP Gen, Chat & Tasks):** To commence during **Phase 6 (Ongoing Improvement)** or as subsequent dedicated project phases, timeline TBD based on priority and resources.

## 6. Scope

* **In Scope (Phases 1-5):**
    * Development and central deployment of core multimodal RAG system.
    * Ingestion/processing of documents & CMMS data.
    * Implementation of 8+ agent framework.
    * Development of role-based UI (with visual/audio/multilingual features and ROI dashboard).
    * Integration of GPU acceleration, security, power efficiency, CI/CD.
    * Architecture and planning for modular integration of Troubleshooting, Multilingual support, and ROI Calculation modules (development likely in Phase 4).
* **Planned Future Scope (Stage 2 / Phase 6+):**
    * **Development and integration of SOP/Instruction Generation assistance module (output requires human review).**
    * Development and integration of User-to-User Chat module.
    * Development and integration of Task Assignment/Management module.
* **Out of Scope (for initial 5 Phases):**
    * Development of Stage 2 SOP Gen, Chat & Task modules.
    * (Other exclusions remain as in v1.1)

## 7. Key Stakeholders
(No changes from v1.1)

## 8. Resource Needs (High-Level)

* **For Phases 1-5:** (As per v1.2).
* **For Stage 2 (Future):** Additional backend developers, potentially frontend effort for SOP review/editing interface, database expertise, **SME time for reviewing generated SOPs.**

## 9. High-Level Success Metrics (KPIs)

* **For Core RAG System (Phases 1-5):** (As per v1.2).
* **For Stage 2 Modules (Future):**
    * **Time reduction in drafting new SOPs/instructions.**
    * **User satisfaction with generated SOP draft quality.**
    * Chat adoption/usage frequency.
    * Task creation and completion rates.
    * User satisfaction with collaboration/workflow features.

## 10. Assumptions
(No major changes from v1.2 for Phases 1-5)
* **SMEs will be available and committed to reviewing/approving AI-generated SOP drafts before use.**

## 11. Risks and Mitigation (High-Level)

* (Risks from v1.2 remain for core system and other modules)
* **Risk (Stage 2 - SOP Gen):** AI-generated SOPs contain critical errors or omissions despite RAG grounding.
    * **Mitigation (Stage 2 - SOP Gen):** **Implement MANDATORY human expert review and approval workflow for all generated procedures. Clearly label outputs as DRAFTS. Train users on the importance of review. Fine-tune prompts for safety and completeness.**
* **Risk (Stage 2 - SOP Gen):** Generated SOPs do not meet required company formatting standards.
    * **Mitigation (Stage 2 - SOP Gen):** Use Markdown generation + post-processing/template engine; accept limitations or invest more in complex formatting generation/prompting.
* **Risk (Stage 2 - Chat/Tasks):** Integrating real-time chat and workflow management increases system complexity.
    * **Mitigation (Stage 2 - Chat/Tasks):** Design with loose coupling; thorough testing; consider API integration with existing platforms.
