# Project Prometheus: Phases Broken Down into Blocks

**Document Version:** 1.5 (Incl. Stage 2 SOP Gen)
**Date:** May 8, 2025
**Prepared by:** AI Systems Lead (with PM Support)

This document outlines the major blocks of work within each phase, noting that SOP Generation, User Chat, and Task Management are planned as "Stage 2" features for development post-Phase 5.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup, CMMS Strategy Execution (Initial Steps), & Initial Agent Validation (Duration: 3-5 weeks)
* **Blocks:**
    * Block 1.1: Strategic Decisions & Foundational Setup
    * Block 1.2: Core Ingestion & Initial Agent Development
    * Block 1.3: Validation, Documentation, & Phase 1 Review

## Phase 2: Enhanced Retrieval (incl. Advanced Diagram/Image Processing & Retrieval), Fusion & Efficiency Baseline (Duration: 4-5 weeks)
* **Blocks:**
    * Block 2.1: Advanced Diagram/Image Identification & Context Association
    * Block 2.2: Specialized Diagram Embedding & Retrieval Strategy
    * Block 2.3: Predictive Caching & Initial Cross-Modal Fusion Logic
    * Block 2.4: Power/Performance Baselining & Modular Design Review

## Phase 3: Scalable Orchestration, Synthesis, UI & CI/CD Setup (Duration: 5-7 weeks)
* **Blocks:**
    * Block 3.1: Agent Orchestration Integration & Core Agent Scaling
    * Block 3.2: Advanced Synthesis & Adaptive Interaction Agent Development (Multimodal Focus)
    * Block 3.3: UI Prototyping (with Diagram Display) & Central-Plant Communication Setup
    * Block 3.4: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation & Initial Power Optimization
    * Block 3.5: Foundational Module Development (Troubleshooting/Multilingual/ROI)

## Phase 4: Production Readiness, Agent Refinement, Security Hardening & Efficiency Tuning (Duration: 6-8 weeks)
* **Blocks:**
    * Block 4.1: Final Core Agent Intelligence & Safety Mechanism Development
    * Block 4.2: Troubleshooting & Multilingual Module Integration & Testing
    * Block 4.3: ROI Calculation Module Development & Integration
    * Block 4.4: Comprehensive Security Implementation & Hardening
    * Block 4.5: Full UI Build (incl. Audio, Language, ROI Dashboard) & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
    * Block 4.6: Production Performance & Power Efficiency Optimization
    * Block 4.7: Mature CI/CD & Deployment Dry Runs

## Phase 5: Central System Deployment, Plant Rollout (Connectivity & Access) & Continuous Improvement Kickoff (Duration: 4-5 weeks)
* **Blocks:**
    * Block 5.1: Central System Production Deployment & Validation
    * Block 5.2: Plant Connectivity Rollout & Access Provisioning (Plants 1-5)
    * Block 5.3: User Training (incl. Module Features) & Go-Live Support
    * Block 5.4: Formal Continuous Improvement Process Establishment (incl. process for reviewing ROI data)

## Phase 6: Ongoing Continuous Improvement & Maintenance (Duration: Continuous)
* **Objective:** Actively monitor, analyze, update, and enhance the deployed system. **Begin development and potential rollout of "Stage 2" features (SOP Gen, Chat, Tasks) based on priority and resources.**
* **Blocks (representing ongoing cycles and potential new feature development):**
    * Block 6.1: Performance Monitoring & Analysis Cycle
    * Block 6.2: User Feedback Integration & Feature Refinement Cycle
    * Block 6.3: Model & Technology Update Cycle
    * Block 6.4: Security & Maintenance Cycle
    * Block 6.5: ROI Module Refinement & Reporting Cycle
    * **Block 6.6 (New - Stage 2): SOP Generation Module Development & Rollout (If prioritized)**
        * **Focus:** Developing Synthesis Agent prompts for SOPs, potential Markdown-to-PDF tool, UI for draft review, and establishing human review workflow.
    * Block 6.7 (Formerly 6.5): Chat Module Development & Rollout (Stage 2)
    * Block 6.8 (Formerly 6.6): Task Management Module Development & Rollout (Stage 2)
